# Introduction

This document serves as a repository for capturing potential features and enhancements to consider for future iterations of the project. Ideas listed here are not prioritized and may evolve over time based on changing requirements and feedback.

# Sample Management

## 1. Custom Attributes

-   Allow users to define custom attributes for samples to capture additional metadata or information.
-   Provide flexibility in defining and managing custom attributes based on user needs.

## 2. Advanced Search Functionality

-   Enhance sample search capabilities with advanced filters and criteria.
-   Allow users to search samples based on a combination of attributes, categories, and other parameters.

# Sample Value Management

## 1. Historical Trends Analysis

-   Implement functionality to analyze historical trends in sample values over time.
-   Provide visualizations and insights into changes and patterns in sample data.

## 2. Automated Data Validation

-   Introduce automated data validation checks to ensure accuracy and consistency of sample values.
-   Flag discrepancies or anomalies in data entries for review and correction.

# Integration

## 1. API Integration

-   Develop an API for seamless integration with external systems or applications.
-   Enable data exchange and interoperability with third-party tools or platforms.

## 2. Export Functionality

-   Implement export functionality to allow users to export sample data in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).
-   Support bulk export of data for reporting, analysis, or sharing purposes.

# System Administration

## 1. Automated Backup and Recovery

-   Set up automated backup processes to regularly back up the database and application data.
-   Implement mechanisms for data recovery in case of system failures or data loss incidents.

## 2. Performance Optimization

-   Optimize system performance to ensure responsiveness and scalability as the dataset grows.
-   Identify and address bottlenecks or inefficiencies in data processing and retrieval.

# Security

## 1. User auth

- Access control mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that only authorized users can view and modify sample data. (This aspect is not a priority for this prototype but should be considered for future iterations if it becomes multi-user)

# Conclusion

The feature backlog serves as a dynamic resource that can be updated and refined over time. As the project progresses and user needs evolve, new ideas may emerge, and existing ones may be reprioritized or refined based on feedback and requirements.
