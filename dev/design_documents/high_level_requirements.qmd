### High-Level Requirements

#### 1. Purpose:

-   Develop a laboratory sample management system to efficiently track and manage various types of samples, primarily for the use of a single user (yourself), with the potential for future expansion to serve a larger user base within the organization.

#### 2. Scope:

-   The system will allow laboratory technicians to:

    -   Record details of supplier samples, including supplier information, references, and lot numbers.

    -   Document lab-prepared samples, specifying relevant attributes and characteristics.

    -   Create sample mixtures by combining multiple parent samples with specified quantities.

    -   Track the lineage of samples, including transformations and changes over time.

    -   Manage analyte values associated with each sample.

-   The following functionalities are NOT within the scope of this project:

    -   Sample Analysis and Reporting: Use cases related to analyzing sample data and generating reports, such as calculating aggregate statistics, trend analysis, or generating compliance reports.

    -   Sample Disposal or Archiving: Use cases for managing the disposal or archiving of samples that are no longer needed for testing or analysis.

    -   Sample Audit Trail: Tracking and auditing changes to sample records, including who made the change, when it was made, and the nature of the change.

### 3. Functional Requirements:

-   **Sample Management**:

    -   Ability to add, view, update, and delete samples of different categories.
    -   Support for recording supplier samples, lab-prepared samples, and sample mixtures.
    -   Functionality to specify attributes such as supplier information, references, lot numbers, and descriptions.

-   **Sample Lineage Tracking**:

    -   Capability to track the lineage of samples, including transformations and changes over time.
    -   Support for recording lot changes and transformations between samples.

-   **Sample Value Management**:

    -   Feature to add, update, and delete analyte values with each sample.
    -   Ability to record values for different parameters and analytes.
    -   Support for version-controlled values for samples, including supplier samples and others.
    -   Versioning functionality for managing changes to sample values, allowing for the creation of new versions with updated or corrected values.
    -   Integration with the versioning system to associate sample values with specific versions of samples.
    -   Version history tracking to maintain a record of changes made to sample values over time.

-   **User Interface**:

    -   Intuitive user interface allowing technicians to easily interact with and manage samples and their associated values.
    -   Search and selection functionality to facilitate the selection of parent samples for mixtures.

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements:

-   **Reliability**:

    -   Data integrity should be maintained, and the system should be robust against errors and failures.

-   **Usability**:

    -   The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, requiring minimal training for laboratory technicians to use effectively.

#### 5. Integration Requirements:

-   **Database Integration**:

    -   Integration with an embedded SQL database to store and manage sample data efficiently. Options considered include DuckDB and SQLite.

-   **Application Framework**:

    -   Development of the application using R and Shiny framework for web-based interface.
