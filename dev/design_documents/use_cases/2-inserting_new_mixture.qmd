### Use Case 2: Inserting a New Sample Mixture

#### Actors:

-   Laboratory Technician: Responsible for creating and managing sample mixtures in the database.

#### Preconditions:

-   The laboratory technician has the necessary permissions to access and modify sample data in the database.
-   The technician has identified the attributes or descriptions of the parent samples to be included in the mixture.

#### Main Success Scenario:

1.  The laboratory technician opens the sample mixture creation form in the application.
2.  The technician selects the option to create a new sample mixture.
3.  The technician navigates to the section for specifying parent samples.
4.  The technician uses the search functionality provided in the form to find and select the parent samples for the mixture based on their attributes or descriptions.
5.  For each parent sample selected, the technician enters the quantity to be included in the mixture.
6.  The technician submits the form to save the new sample mixture.
7.  The application validates the entered data to ensure it meets the required constraints.
8.  If validation is successful, the application inserts the new sample mixture record into the database.
9.  The application displays a confirmation message indicating that the sample mixture has been successfully created.

#### Alternate Paths:

-   **Invalid Data**: If the entered data fails validation, the application displays error messages indicating the specific validation errors. The technician corrects the errors and resubmits the form.
-   **Cancellation**: If the technician decides to cancel the operation, they can close the form without saving the changes, and no new sample mixture is created.

#### Postconditions:

-   The new sample mixture record is successfully inserted into the database.
-   The database reflects the updated state with the addition of the new sample mixture.

#### Examples:

-   **Example 1**: The laboratory technician creates a new sample mixture by selecting Sample A (supplier sample with reference "ABC123") and Sample B (lab-prepared sample with description "Standard Solution") in a ratio of 1:2.
-   **Example 2**: The technician creates a sample mixture consisting of Sample C (mixture sample with ID 789) and Sample D (supplier sample with supplier "Supplier X" and reference "XYZ456") in equal proportions.
