### Use Case 7: Search and Retrieve Samples

#### Actors:
- Laboratory Technician: Responsible for searching and retrieving samples in the system.

#### Preconditions:
- The user has the necessary permissions to access and search sample data.
- The system contains sample records to be searched.

#### Main Success Scenario:
1. The laboratory technician opens the sample search interface in the application.
2. The technician specifies search criteria such as sample ID, category, supplier, or specific attributes.
3. The application retrieves samples matching the specified criteria and displays them in a list.
4. The technician reviews the list of retrieved samples and selects the desired sample(s) for further action.

#### Alternate Paths:
- **No Results**: If no samples match the specified search criteria, the application displays a message indicating that no results were found.
- **Refinement**: If the initial search results are too broad, the technician may refine the search criteria and repeat the search process.

#### Postconditions:
- The technician successfully retrieves the desired sample(s) based on the specified search criteria.

#### Examples:
- **Example 1**: The laboratory technician searches for all samples belonging to the category "Clinical Chemistry Controls." The application returns a list of samples matching this category.
- **Example 2**: The technician searches for samples supplied by "Supplier A" with expiry dates within the next month. The application retrieves samples meeting these criteria for further review.
