**Use Case 4: Insert Analyte Values for Sample (Version 1)**

**Actor**: Laboratory Technician

**Description**: This use case describes the process of inserting
analyte values for a sample for the first time, creating the initial
version (version 1) of analyte values associated with the sample.

**Preconditions**: - The user is authenticated and authorized to insert
analyte values for samples. - The sample for which analyte values are to
be inserted exists in the system. - All parameters (measurement
procedures) for which values are to be inserted have been registered in
the database.

**Basic Flow**: 1. **Initiate Analyte Value Insertion**: - The user
selects the option to insert analyte values for a sample in the system.

2.  **Select Sample**:
    -   The system presents a list of samples for which analyte values
        can be inserted.
    -   The user selects the sample for which they want to insert
        analyte values.
3.  **Enter Analyte Values**:
    -   The system retrieves all registered parameters (measurement
        procedures) from the database.
    -   The system displays a table with columns for parameters and
        corresponding value fields.
    -   The user enters the values for each parameter, ensuring accuracy
        and completeness.
4.  **Review and Confirm**:
    -   The system displays a summary of the entered analyte values for
        review.
    -   The user verifies the correctness of the entered values.
    -   The user confirms the insertion of analyte values for the
        sample.
5.  **Save Analyte Values**:
    -   The system saves the entered analyte values for the sample as
        version 1.
    -   The system assigns a unique identifier (version number) to the
        set of analyte values for traceability.

**Alternate Flows**: - **Cancel Analyte Value Insertion**: - At any step
during the analyte value insertion process, the user may choose to
cancel the operation. - The system aborts the insertion process and
returns the user to the previous screen.

**Postconditions**: - The analyte values are successfully inserted for
the sample as version 1. - The system maintains a record of the inserted
analyte values, associating them with the sample and version number.

**Exceptions**: - **Invalid Input**: - If the user provides invalid or
incomplete values for any parameter, the system prompts for correction
and validation. - **System Error**: - If the system encounters an error
during the analyte value insertion process, an error message is
displayed, and the user is prompted to retry or contact support.
