### Use Case 8: View Sample Details

#### Actors:
- Laboratory Technician: Responsible for viewing detailed information about samples.

#### Preconditions:
- The user has successfully retrieved a sample using the search and retrieval functionality.

#### Main Success Scenario:
1. The laboratory technician selects a sample from the list of retrieved samples.
2. The application displays detailed information about the selected sample, including its category, supplier, lot details, associated values, and any additional attributes.
3. The technician reviews the sample details to obtain the necessary information for further analysis or action.

#### Alternate Paths:
