### Use Case 1: Inserting a New Sample

#### Actors:

-   Laboratory Technician: Responsible for entering new samples into the database.

#### Preconditions:

-   The laboratory technician has the necessary permissions to access the database.
-   The laboratory technician has the required information about the sample to be entered, including its category, supplier information, lot details, and any associated values or measurements.

#### Main Success Scenario:

1.  The laboratory technician opens the sample insertion form in the application.
2.  The technician enters the details of the new sample, including its category, supplier, reference, lot, date of manufacture, date of expiry, and any additional information.
3.  The technician submits the form.
4.  The application validates the entered data to ensure it meets the required constraints (e.g., mandatory fields are filled, date formats are correct, etc.).
5.  If validation is successful, the application inserts the new sample record into the database.
6.  The application displays a confirmation message indicating that the sample insertion was successful.

#### Alternate Paths:

-   **Invalid Data**: If the entered data fails validation, the application displays error messages indicating the specific validation errors. The technician corrects the errors and resubmits the form.
-   **Cancellation**: If the technician decides to cancel the operation, they can close the form without submitting it, and no changes are made to the database.

#### Postconditions:

-   The new sample record is successfully inserted into the database.
-   The database reflects the updated state with the addition of the new sample.

#### Examples:

-   **Example 1**: The laboratory technician enters a new commercial sample provided by Supplier A with reference number ABC123 and lot number 123456. The sample has a date of manufacture of 2024-02-28 and an expiry date of 2024-03-31.
-   **Example 2**: The laboratory technician enters a new lab-prepared sample with a custom reference and lot number, along with relevant details such as date of manufacture and expiry.
